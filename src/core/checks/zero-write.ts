/**
 * CHECK 4 — write steps that can complete having written zero rows.
 *
 * The question this answers is NOT "did this workflow write nothing" — static
 * JSON can never answer that. It answers "can this workflow finish green having
 * written nothing, and would anyone notice". That is a blind-spot report, not a
 * bug report, and the wording throughout keeps that distinction.
 *
 * Method: for every write node W, find the nodes that DOMINATE it — the steps
 * that every path from a trigger to W must pass through. If any dominator can
 * emit zero items, W is skipped entirely and the run still reports success.
 *
 * Dominators rather than path enumeration, because a 246-node workflow with 40
 * branches has too many paths to walk, and because a gate only truly starves W
 * if there is no alternative path around it. Dominance is exactly that property.
